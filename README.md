# Identify Data Formats

## Overview
Data is a collection of facts used to record information, often organized in structures representing entities important to an organization (e.g., customers, products). Entities have attributes (e.g., name, address).

## Data Classifications
Data can be classified as:
- **Structured**
- **Semi-structured**
- **Unstructured**

### Structured Data
- Adheres to a fixed schema.
- Commonly tabular (rows and columns).
- Stored in databases using a relational model.

**Example: Customer and Product tables**

### Semi-structured Data
- Has some structure with variations between instances.
- Common format: JSON.

**Example:**
- Customer documents with varying address and contact information.

*Note: JSON is just one of many semi-structured data representations.*

### Unstructured Data
- No specific structure.
- Includes documents, images, audio, video, and binary files.

## Data Stores
Organizations store data in structured, semi-structured, or unstructured formats for recording details of entities, events, or other information. Stored data is retrieved for analysis and reporting.

### Types of Data Stores
1. **File stores**
2. **Databases**
